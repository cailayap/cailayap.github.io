                            <p id ="first"> To everyone who never stopped pushing me beyond my limits, thank you. There were so many times that I wanted to give up on my course and even my life, but you were all there cheering me on, letting me know that nothing is impossible and that I could overcome anything. </p>
                            <p id ="first">All of you have been my shoulder to cry on, my stress relievers and my happy pills. </p>
                            <p id ="first">Every breakdown I have, you were there pulling me back up and you were reminding me that my time is not over yet. All of you constantly tried to make me feel better every time my anxiety kicks in. You reminded me that I am bigger than my anxiety and that I could fight it. You made me realize that I am still as strong as I was before.</p>
                            <p id ="first">You have changed my perspective in life completely, and I thank you for that. </p>
                            <p id ="first">You have reminded me to make the most out of my time here and to never waste an opportunity. You have given me lessons to live by, and you have made me realized that every mistake there is a consequence and that I have to learn from all of it. Thank you for helping me start again, I would be completely lost without all of you. Thank you for the unending love and support, you do not know how much all of those have motivated me and kept me going. All of you are an inspiration to me, and you will always be. I will forever owe you my life, thank you!</p>
