                        <p id="first">Knowing you was already a blessing but having the opportunity to love you was a much bigger blessing. You are the love my life and I would be more than blessed to spend the rest of my life with you.</p>
                        <p id="first">You are the man I have always dreamed of.</p>
                        <p id="first">I have always dreamed of having someone that would understand me for who I am, would love me for who I am as well. I envisioned my future husband to be someone who always sees the good in others, and someone who values trust. A man who never forgets to keep her woman happy, a man who handles rough situations maturely is also a man I desired.  And, my love, you are all that. You have shown me that you are capable of loving me even if I am hard to love. You have seen me at my worst and yet you still found a reason to stay and love me even more. We have our share of downturns, but you handle everything perfectly. You keep me happy, even if I am the moodiest person in the whole world, you never fail to turn each frown into a smile. And most importantly, you trust me completely with your whole life.</p>
                        <p id="first">I promise to be the woman that you deserve.</p>
                        <p id="first">I may not be perfect, but I try to be, and I promise to never stop trying. You deserve the world, love, and I will give that to you. I promise to be always by your side no matter what, I will always listen and understand you and your feelings. I promise to love you every second of every minute of every hour of every day.</p>
                        <p id="first">You are my favorite everything.</p>
                        <p id="first">You are my favorite person in the entire world, no one knows me like you do. I can be myself when I am around you and that is the best part. I am truly the happiest when I am with you. I truly believe that you are the man desired for me. I hope that you never get tired of loving me, because I will never get tired of loving you.</p>
