Both of her parents have a degree in engineering, her dad took up Electrical Engineering, while her mom took up Chemical Engineering. That is one of the reasons why she is currently taking up Industrial Engineering in De La Salle University - Manila. She is considering to take up her masters after getting a degree in engineering. Her interests include dancing, cheerleading, writing and reading. One of her goals in life is to have her own business and expand it someday.</b>
